# Index to Podcast
Experimental io.js service for transforming an Apache index page into a Podcast RSS feed.

This is a proof of concept, and has no practical use case. It scrapes the BassDrive Archives' specific format of links and transforms them into a Podcast formatted RSS feed. You need to provide the `path` and `title` as GET parameters.
